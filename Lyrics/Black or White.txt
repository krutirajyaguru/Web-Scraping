Lyrics: I took my baby
On a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we’re one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle
Has happened tonight

But, if you’re thinkin’
About my baby
It don’t matter if you’re
Black or white

They print my message
In the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain’t second to none

And I told about equality
And it’s true
Either you’re wrong
Or you’re right

But, if you’re thinkin’
About my baby
It don’t matter if you’re
Black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough

I ain’t scared of your brother
I ain’t scared of no sheets
I ain’t scared of nobody
Girl, when the goin’ gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It’s a turf war on a global scale
I’d rather hear both sides of the tale

See, it’s not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is

I’ve seen the bright get duller
I’m not going to spend
My life being a color

Don’t tell me
You agree with me
When I saw you kicking
Dirt in my eye

But, if you’re thinkin’
About my baby
It don’t matter if you’re
Black or white

I said if you’re thinkin’
Of being my baby
It don’t matter if you’re
Black or white

I said if you’re thinkin’
Of being my brother
It don’t matter if you’re
Black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea, now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea, now

It’s black, it’s white
It’s tough for you
To get by
It’s black , it’s white, whoo

It’s black, it’s white
It’s tough for you
To get by
It’s black , it’s white, whoo
