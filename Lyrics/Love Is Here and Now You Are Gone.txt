Lyrics: Got to be there, got to be there in the morning
When she says hello to the world.
Got to be there, got to be there,
Bring her good times and show her that she's my girl.
Oh, what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me.
'Cause when I look in her eyes.
I realize I need her sharing the world beside me.
So I've got to be there, got to be there in the morning,
And welcome her into my world,
And show her that she's my girl.
When she says hello world!
Got to be there.
I need her sharing the world beside me.

That's why I've got to be there, got to be there
Where love begins and that's everywhere she goes,
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me she's home, yeah

Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.
Got to be there, oh baby baby got to be there, got to be there.
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.
Got to be there, oh got to be there, got to be there.
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.
