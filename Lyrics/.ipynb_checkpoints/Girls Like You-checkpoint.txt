Song: Girls Like You

Lyrics: Spent twenty-four hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

But now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe
And play me close

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you

I spent last night on the last flight to you
You took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
We spent the daylight tryna make things right between us

But now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe
And play me close

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
I need a girl like you

Maybe it's 6:45
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe you're thinking it's better if you drive

Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama 
You don't want a girl like me I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet, it's fugazi
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden?
I'm coming to you now doin' twenty over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop 
I don't play when it comes to my heart (let's get it though)
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinkin' more of white Porsches and karats
I need you right here 'cause every time you call
I play with this kitty like you play with your guitar

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
