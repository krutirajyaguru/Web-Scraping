[1mLyrics: I took my baby
On a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, weâ€™re one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle
Has happened tonight

But, if youâ€™re thinkinâ€™
About my baby
It donâ€™t matter if youâ€™re
Black or white

They print my message
In the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ainâ€™t second to none

And I told about equality
And itâ€™s true
Either youâ€™re wrong
Or youâ€™re right

But, if youâ€™re thinkinâ€™
About my baby
It donâ€™t matter if youâ€™re
Black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough

I ainâ€™t scared of your brother
I ainâ€™t scared of no sheets
I ainâ€™t scared of nobody
Girl, when the goinâ€™ gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
Itâ€™s a turf war on a global scale
Iâ€™d rather hear both sides of the tale

See, itâ€™s not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is

Iâ€™ve seen the bright get duller
Iâ€™m not going to spend
My life being a color

Donâ€™t tell me
You agree with me
When I saw you kicking
Dirt in my eye

But, if youâ€™re thinkinâ€™
About my baby
It donâ€™t matter if youâ€™re
Black or white

I said if youâ€™re thinkinâ€™
Of being my baby
It donâ€™t matter if youâ€™re
Black or white

I said if youâ€™re thinkinâ€™
Of being my brother
It donâ€™t matter if youâ€™re
Black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea, now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea, now

Itâ€™s black, itâ€™s white
Itâ€™s tough for you
To get by
Itâ€™s black , itâ€™s white, whoo

Itâ€™s black, itâ€™s white
Itâ€™s tough for you
To get by
Itâ€™s black , itâ€™s white, whoo
