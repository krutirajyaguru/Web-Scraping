Song: Ain't No Sunshine

Lyrics: You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day, you get it
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right know I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause, ooh

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she always gone too long
Anytime she goes away, yeah

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away (anytime she goes away)
Hmm

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know
Hey, I ought to leave (ought to leave)
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone (ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone (ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Only darkness every day (only darkness every day)
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away (anytime she goes away)

Ooh (ain't no sun)
Ooh (ain't no sun)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na (whoa)
Anytime she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone (ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
(It's not warm when she's away) It's not warm when she's away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Goes away, no, no, no, no
Anytime she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Anytime she goes away
Only darkness every day
Anytime she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Anytime that she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
