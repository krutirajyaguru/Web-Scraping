Song: I Want You Back

Lyrics: When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

Then someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
'Cause now since I see you it is all
I want you back
Yes, I do now
I want you back
Oo oo baby
I want you back
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I want you back
Now now now now

Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
(Let me show you now)

Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
'Cause now since I see you it is all

Ah bah bah bah buh

Song: I Want You Back

Lyrics: Uh ohh
Let me tell you now
Uh huh

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back) yes, I do now
(I want you back) ooh ooh, baby
(I want you back) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want you back) Now, now, now, now

Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
(Let me show you now)

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms 
(Ohh) (bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum) ah, buh bum, bum, bum 
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum) ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I want
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum) ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I need
