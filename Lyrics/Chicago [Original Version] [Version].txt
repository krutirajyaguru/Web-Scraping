Lyrics: I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was wanting me)
She said just to give her a page
To spend the night was the goal she played (She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was loving me, loving me yeah

I never would have thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near she would tell me how she feels
If felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was wanting me)
She said just to give her a page
To spend the night was the goal she played (She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was loving me, loving me yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife (She was wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can (She was wanting me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family yeah

I didn’t know she was already spoken for
‘cause I’m not that kind of man
Swear that I would’ve never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I’m holding her to blame

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (Holding her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (Holding her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
To spend the night was the goal she played (Holding her to blame)
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was loving me, loving me yeah (Holding her to blame)

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family yeah
