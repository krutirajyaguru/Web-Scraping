Song: Happy

Lyrics: Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I till you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was
(Till now)

Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was till nowArtist: Michael Jackson

Song: Happy

Lyrics: I've played the game of love before
Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought
The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you
