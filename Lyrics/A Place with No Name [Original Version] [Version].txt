Lyrics: As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Woah oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
There's no in fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
Grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen and things I've never done
This place really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
We're in a world that I wanna lead

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
