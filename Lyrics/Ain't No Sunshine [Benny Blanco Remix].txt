Lyrics: Can it be I stayed away too long 
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back 
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming 
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the meaning to your story 
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Well it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

I wanna wanna be where you are, uh oh
Anywhere you are
I wanna wanna be where you are, oh
Everywhere you are, oh

Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

Oh oh

I wanna wanna be where you are uh oh
Any any anywhere you are oh oh
I wanna wanna be where you are uh oh
I gotta gotta be where you are uh oh

I wanna be I wanna be I
Yeah yeah baby now
I wanna be I wanna be I ooh
I wanna be I wanna be I
Na na yeah yeah
I wanna be I wanna be I
I wanna be I wanna be I
Na na baby
I wanna be I wanna be I
I wanna be I wanna be I
Ooh ooh baby
I wanna be I wanna be I
I wanna be I wanna be ooh
Yeah yeah baby nw
I wanna be I wanna be oh ooh
I wanna be I wanna be oh
Na na yeah yeah
