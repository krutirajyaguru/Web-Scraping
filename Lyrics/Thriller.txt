Song: Thriller

Lyrics: It's close to midnight 
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight 
You see a sight that almost stops your heart

You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze 
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah

Oh oh oh

You hear the door slam 
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand 
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You close your eyes 
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while 
You hear the creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, oh

They're out to get you; 
There's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you 
Unless you change that number on your dial

Now is the time 
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night 
I'll save you from the terrors on the screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller 
Chiller thriller here tonight

'Cause it's a thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ohh baby (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (Oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night (Thriller night)

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
