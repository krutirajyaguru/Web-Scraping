Artist: Michael Jackson
Album: Forever [Bonus Tracks] [2014]
Song: There Must Be More to Life Than This [William Orbit Mix]

Lyrics: There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces

There must be more to life than living
There must be more that needs the light
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying see'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
A living hope for a world fill with love
And waking up, just making noise

There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
A living hope for a world fill with love
There must be more to life, than this

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than thisArtist: Michael Jackson

A living hope for a world fill with love
And waking up, just making noise

There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
A living hope for a world fill with love
There must be more to life, than this

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this
