Song: My Girl

Lyrics: I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl

I've even got the month of May

Song: My Girl

Lyrics: I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey (got honey)
The bees envy me (the bees envy me)
I've got a sweeter song, yeah (sweeter song, yeah)
Than the birds in the trees (the birds in the trees)
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (talkin' 'bout my girl)

Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do (hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

I love my baby
She makes me feel proud
I climb the highest mountain
And say it out loud

I don't need no money, yeah, fortune and fame
I get all the riches, baby, one man can claim (that one man can claim)

Well, I guess you say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl)
Talkin' about my girl

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl (my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)
Ooh, yeah, my girl (my girl)
Ooh, my girl (my girl), that's one thing I can talk about is
My girl (my girl)
