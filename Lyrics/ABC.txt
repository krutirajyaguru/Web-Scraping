Lyrics: A buh-buh buh buh-buh

A buh-buh buh buh-buh

You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before

Like I before E except after C

And why two plus two makes four
Now now now, I'm gonna teach you
Teach you, teach you

All about love, dear
All about love

Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me.

ABC
Easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl!
ABC
Easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me!

Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
I'm a going to teach how to sing it out!
Michael, come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!

Reading, writing and arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree

But without the roots of love every day, girl

Your education ain't complete
T-T-T-Teacher's gonna show you

Show you, show you

How to get an A!

Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!

Spell "me" "you"
Add the two!
Listen to me baby, that's all you gotta do!

Oh, ABC
As easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl!
ABC
It's easy,
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be!

Sit down, girl!
I think I love you!
No!
Get up, girl!
Show me what you can do!

Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now!
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooh ooh!
Shake it shake it, baby, huh!
One, two, three, baby, ooh ooh!
ABC, baby, nah nah!
Do re mi, baby, huh!
That's how easy love can be.

Song: ABC

Lyrics: A buh-buh buh buh-buh

A buh-buh buh buh-buh

You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before

Like I before E except after C

And why two plus two makes four
Now now now, I'm gonna teach you
Teach you, teach you

All about love, dear
All about love

Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me.

ABC
Easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl!
ABC
Easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me!

Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
I'm a going to teach how to sing it out!
Michael, come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!

Reading, writing and arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree

But without the roots of love every day, girl

Your education ain't complete
T-T-T-Teacher's gonna show you

Show you, show you

How to get an A!

Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!

Spell "me" "you"
Add the two!
Listen to me baby, that's all you gotta do!

Oh, ABC
As easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl!
ABC
It's easy,
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be!

Sit down, girl!
I think I love you!
No!
Get up, girl!
Show me what you can do!

Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now!
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooh ooh!
Shake it shake it, baby, huh!
One, two, three, baby, ooh ooh!
ABC, baby, nah nah!
Do re mi, baby, huh!
That's how easy love can be.

ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be!
(I'm not gonna teach you how to sing it out)
Come on come on come on let me show you what it's all about
ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be!
(I'm not gonna teach you how to sing it out)
Sing it out, sing it, sing it, sing it
Oh baby, ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be!Artist: Michael Jackson
